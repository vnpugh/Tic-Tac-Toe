HURDLES
*CSS Layout - took alot of trial and error
*Working on the logic - the more animations and extras I wanted to include, this required researching
the implementation and updating the code
*Figuring out how to disable the new-game-btn after a game has been played. I already added the disabled attribute to the newGameButton in the startNewGame function.
