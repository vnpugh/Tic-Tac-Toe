<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Are you ready to play a classic game? Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a timeless game played by two players on a 3x3 grid. This project is all about creating a fun and interactive version of Tic-Tac-Toe that you can play with a friend on the same computer. By leveraging HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and DOM manipulation, I've created a dynamic game that is easy to play and visually appealing while following best coding practices (Don't Repeat Yourself). So, get ready to experience the classic game like never before.

<h1>The Planning Process</h1>
<p>
Planning before writing code and starting a project is crucial to ensure its success. This process helps define the project's objectives, identify the requirements, and reduce scope creep. As a developer, I started by identifying the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - the bare minimum required to deliver the desired outcome. In the case of building a Tic-Tac-Toe board, the acceptable MVP consists of an HTML page with a table of nine cells, enough Javascript to display the current player, and a touch of CSS to make the cells visible. I then begin by creating a basic version of the game in HTML and CSS with minimal styling. This approach allowed me to focus on delivering a product that meets the project's objectives while keeping the ultimate goal in sight.
