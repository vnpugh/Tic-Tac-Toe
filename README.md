<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Are you ready to play a classic game? Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a timeless game played by two players on a 3x3 grid. This project is all about creating a fun and interactive version of Tic-Tac-Toe that you can play with a friend on the same computer. By leveraging HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and DOM manipulation, I've created a dynamic game that is easy to play and visually appealing while following best coding practices (Don't Repeat Yourself).
So, get ready to experience the classic game like never before.
